# 2.0.0

## Breaking Changes

- Package now only exports to ESM.

# 1.7.1

- Correct lack of exports.

# 1.7.0

- Features
  - Added the `PhoneLink` and `EmailLink` components.
  - Added the `Grid` and `GridArea` components.
    - Very exciting addition to JTJS! Grid is a very useful but complex feature of CSS and I've wanted an easy way to interact with it akin to how `Flexbox` lets me interact with CSS flex. These components should simplify many of the common use cases of CSS grid.

# 1.6.0

- Features
  - #5: Added `AsyncButton` component and tweaked `StructuredDialog` to use it as its button implementation.

# 1.5.0

- Bugfixes
  - #3: `exclusive` option for `useChordDown` now works as intended.
- Features
  - #4: Added several Dialog components.
